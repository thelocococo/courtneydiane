     </h3>
     Today's workshop was the Personal Website. I <i>have</i> actually done this one before, and doing it again was refreshing, and it helped me to relearn some concepts. This one, though I might be speaking too soon, is my favorite because I've always wanted a personal website, and didn't want to use a third-party platform where I'd only be telling it what I wanted on my site while it did the work. I was really surprised at how easy this is!

     <b> I rate this workshop 10/10. The instructions were very clear, and it was simple! ðŸ¥° </b>

       Eight days later, I am finally finished with Workshop #2. This one was a tad bit harder than the first. There were some new concepts that I'll have to get used to, but, overally, I really enjoyed the outcome. Shoutout to @aids for helping me fix that white space issue ðŸ˜…. Honestly, the second time was just as hard as doing it the first time, but I'll definitely do it again in the future for practice. Once thing I like about it is how creative you can get. </p>
